          <p>
            Hello! I’m <strong>Shubham (JVKE)</strong> a passionate full stack
            developer who loves turning ideas into powerful web experiences. I
            specialize in building modern, responsive apps using the{" "}
            <strong>MERN stack</strong>, and I'm currently diving into{" "}
            <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>Next.js</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey began with curiosity and evolved into a deep love for
            crafting clean UIs and scalable backends. From e-commerce platforms
            to feedback systems, I’ve built full-stack projects learning from
            every success and blunder.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m learning
            <strong>Python</strong>, and preparing for my{" "}
            <strong>BCA degree at IGNOU</strong>. Whether it's setting up APIs
            or debugging UI at midnight. I’m always excited to build.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have a strong <strong>American accent</strong> not just for
            style, but for clarity, confidence, and connecting with clients and
            collaborators globally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Music keeps me grounded, and <strong>Billie Eilish</strong> fuels my
            vibe. Her raw emotion and minimalism inspire not just playlists,
            but also how I write and design clean code.
          </p>

          <p>Let’s build something beautiful together.</p>
